
# Invoke-IcingaCheckEventlog

## Description

Checks how many eventlog occurrences of a given type there are.

Invoke-IcingaCheckEventlog returns either 'OK', 'WARNING' or 'CRITICAL', based on the thresholds set.
e.g Eventlog returns 500 entries with the specified parameters, WARNING is set to 200, CRITICAL is set to 800. Thereby the check will return WARNING.

By default if no time frame is selected with `-After` for example, the plugin will fetch EventLog information from the last two hours.
In case your are not using `-DisableTimeCache`, the plugin will after the first execution only collect the delta between the last
execution time and the current execution time.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---      | ---  | ---      | ---     | ---         |
| Warning | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Warning threshold. |
| Critical | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Critical threshold. |
| LogName | String | false |  | Used to specify a certain log. |
| IncludeEventId | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of events identified by their id to be included. |
| ExcludeEventId | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of events identified by their id to be excluded. |
| IncludeUsername | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of usernames within the eventlog to be included. |
| ExcludeUsername | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of usernames within the eventlog to be excluded. |
| IncludeEntryType | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of entry types within the eventlog to be included. Please note that `SuccessAudit` and `FailureAudit` only apply to the `Security` EventLog. |
| ExcludeEntryType | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of entry types within the eventlog to be excluded. Please note that `SuccessAudit` and `FailureAudit` only apply to the `Security` EventLog. |
| IncludeMessage | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of messages within the eventlog to be included. |
| ExcludeMessage | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of messages within the eventlog to be excluded. |
| IncludeSource | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of message sources within the eventlog to be included. |
| ExcludeSource | Array | false | @() | Used to specify an array of message sources within the eventlog to be excluded. |
| After | Object | false |  | Used to specify time data of which point the plugin should start to read event logs from. You can either use a fixed date and time like "2021/01/30 12:00:00", a fixed day "2021/01/30" or use more dynamic approaches like "1d", "10h" and so on.  Allowed units: ms, s, m, h, d, w, M, y |
| Before | Object | false |  | Used to specify time data of which point the plugin should stop considering event logs. You can either use a fixed date and time like "2021/01/30 12:00:00", a fixed day "2021/01/30" or use more dynamic approaches like "1d", "10h" and so on.  By using "2h" for example, log files of the last 2 hours will be ignored. Please ensure to manually set the `-After` argument and ensure you go back further in time with the `-After` argument than the `-Before` argument.  Allowed units: ms, s, m, h, d, w, M, y |
| MaxEntries | Int32 | false | 40000 | Allows to limit the amount of log entries fetched by Get-WinEvent, to increase performance and reduce system load impact Should match the average amount of log files written for the intended time range filtered |
| DisableTimeCache | SwitchParameter | false | False | Switch to disable the time cache on a check. If this parameter is set the time cache is disabled. After the check has been run once, the next check instance will filter through the eventlog from the point the last check ended. This is due to the time cache, when disabled the whole eventlog is checked instead. |
| NoPerfData | SwitchParameter | false | False | Used to disable PerfData. |
| Verbosity | Int32 | false | 0 | Changes the behavior of the plugin output which check states are printed: 0 (default): Only service checks/packages with state not OK will be printed 1: Only services with not OK will be printed including OK checks of affected check packages including Package config 2: Everything will be printed regardless of the check state 3: Identical to Verbose 2, but prints in addition the check package configuration e.g (All must be [OK]) |
| ThresholdInterval | String |  |  | Change the value your defined threshold checks against from the current value to a collected time threshold of the Icinga for Windows daemon, as described [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/service/10-Register-Service-Checks/). An example for this argument would be 1m or 15m which will use the average of 1m or 15m for monitoring. |
